* Mail Server Spec
** Idea
   is that there is a mail server that we will use as the error repository
   Is this a good idea, maybe not, but every seems to be able to talk SMTP now
   So all your errors get sent to our good friend the email throttler, and then it does crap with them!
   Still sending them over the wire (but you would anyway well maybe)
